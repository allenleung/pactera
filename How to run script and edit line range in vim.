How to run this script:

1. Make sure both the sheet and script are in the same file path (I leave both on my desktop)
2. Run the following command:

sed -i -E -f aus.sed sheetname.txt

Replace sheetname with the name of your sheet.

How to edit the range of lines in VIM:

1. Move the sheet that you're working on to your desktop.
2. Open up a terminal (Command space > terminal)
3. Type in this command: cd desktop
4. Then type: vim sheetname
 - Replace sheetname with the name of your sheet
 - Include any extensions at the end [name of your sheet.txt]
5. Enter the commands exactly as follows:
 :%s/111/Desired start line/g
 :%s/222/Desired end line/g
6. After running both of those commands, type
:wq [This will save the edits made to the sheet and close the vim text editor]
